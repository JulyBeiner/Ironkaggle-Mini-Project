    "King County House Sale Price Analysis (2014-2015)\n",
    "Overview\n",
    "This project explores the house sale price data for King County, including Seattle, spanning from May 2014 to May 2015. Our mission is to analyze key factors that impact housing prices and build a predictive model to estimate house sale prices. This project was conducted over three days, simulating a real-world scenario of collaborative data analysis and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Project Timeline\n",
    "Day 1: Data Loading and Initial Exploration\n",
    "Tasks:\n",
    "Download the dataset and load it into Python.\n",
    "Conduct preliminary data exploration to understand the structure and distribution of the data.\n",
    "Create initial visualizations to identify patterns and relationships between variables.\n",
    "Goal: Familiarize the team with the data and start hypothesizing which features might impact house prices.\n",
    "Day 2: Data Analysis and Model Building\n",
    "Tasks:\n",
    "Clean and preprocess the dataset (handle missing values, scale features, etc.).\n",
    "Conduct deeper exploratory data analysis (EDA) to determine the most impactful variables.\n",
    "Develop and train a machine learning model (e.g., linear regression) for predicting house prices.\n",
    "Goal: Create a baseline model and assess its performance using relevant metrics.\n",
    "Day 3: Model Refinement and Presentation\n",
    "Tasks:\n",
    "Fine-tune the model for better accuracy and robustness.\n",
    "Finalize visualizations to support model results.\n",
    "Prepare a presentation summarizing the machine learning process and results.\n",
    "Goal: Present findings and demonstrate the model's predictive capabilities.\n",
